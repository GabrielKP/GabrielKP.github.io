## Vision

I am dedicated to become a researcher in the intersection of Computer Science,
Cognitive Science, Psychology and Neuroscience to understand the workings of the human mind, the usage of that knowledge in Computer Science and resulting from that, to create technologies improving our living conditions.

I am deeply passionate about discovering and implementing the algorithms behind perception, cognition and behaviour.

Being in the middle of forming the foundation of my future scientific career, I am
learning about new topics and absorbing all advice, experiences and lessons I can.

Full of ideas, ambitious plans and a probably hopelessly overly idealistic worldview I am trying to reach for the stars. Let's see what the future holds.

## Fun 'facts'

- People tell me I look shorter on Zoom than in Real Life.
- Yes, I started growing my hair before Corona.
- No, I still have not found the right hair routine.
- I was (second degree) uncle before I was born.
- Because I grew up bilingually, I sometimes confuse numbers in the range of
  60-99: in German you say the last position first, in Spanish it is the other way
  around (It is interesting that I only noticed the phenomenon for numbers >60).
- I seem to be bad in _deciphering_ what people say, even though my
  hearing itself is good (according to doctors...).
- [The best Hot Chocolate place in Berlin](https://www.berliner-kaffeeroesterei.de/).
- Yes, I like the US
- Put on 80/90/00s music and I _dance, dance, dance_.
- My metabolism does not abide by the laws of the universe, if I eat a piece of
  cake I gain double of it's weight the next day.
- Luckily I lose weight as fast as I gain it.
- Yes, my phenotype is the analog of mixing coffee with milk.
- I am bad with names AND faces, but I am not prosopagnosic.
- Is it a science if you have to put 'science' into the fields name?
