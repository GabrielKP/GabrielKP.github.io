## Vision

I am dedicated to becoming a researcher at the intersection of Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Psychology and Neuroscience. I want to understand the workings of the human mind and eventually use that knowledge
to create technologies that improve our living conditions.

I am deeply passionate about discovering and implementing the algorithms behind perception, cognition and behaviour.

Being in the middle of forming the foundation of my future scientific career, I am
learning about new topics and absorbing all advice, experiences and lessons I can.

Full of ideas, ambitious plans and a probably hopelessly overly idealistic worldview, I am trying to reach for the stars.
Let's see what the future holds.

## Fun 'facts'

- People tell me I look shorter on Zoom than in Real Life.
- Yes, I started growing my hair before Corona.
- No, I still have not found the right hair routine.
- I was (second degree) uncle before I was born.
- Because I grew up bilingually, I sometimes confuse numbers in the range of
  60-99: in German you say the last position first. In Spanish it is the other way
  around (It is interesting that I only noticed the phenomenon for numbers >60).
- I seem to be bad at _deciphering_ what people say, even though my
  hearing itself is good (according to some doctor in Berlin...).
- [The best Hot Chocolate place in Berlin](https://www.berliner-kaffeeroesterei.de/).
- Yes, I like the US.
- Put on 80/90/00s music and I _dance, dance, dance_.
- My metabolism does not abide by the laws of the universe, if I eat a piece of
  cake I gain double of it's weight the next day.
- Luckily, I lose weight as fast as I gain it.
- Yes, my phenotype is the analog of mixing coffee with milk.
- I am bad with names AND faces, but I am not prosopagnosic.
